Hellow everyone!

# Project resume
The company called "Packed company" throw solid materials in a river, the company thinking thant this solid material donÂ´t cause a siginificative impact for the flora and fauna for the river.
This company know the rules at the citie, NOM_XX01, this said than the percentage of amoniac permittied is 0.2% for each liter of water.
The company take a sample and measure this percentage of amoniac in two places, RIVER UP and RIVER DOWN, the reference for thoses places is the deposit zone of solid material.
This company was testing for compression the solid materias to diferent force (N/m2) and they have 500 data from this testing, and measure the percentage than amoniac than realease into the river.
You how a Enginneer and software develoment, to need the next for this company we needed to do the follow:
1. Draw the histogram for the sample measure RIVER UP and RIVER DOWN.
2. Demonstrate normality in the data, with the central limit theorem.
3. Draw and get the lineal regression whith the data than the company have.
4. Create a interactive view, when the company can calculate the stimate value for amoniac realease into the river for each leavel of force than the company want.
5. In the view about, need a form when the company insert new data for the future experiment.
6. You need to have a view when the company can look the box plot from the samples RIVER UP and RIVER DOWN, and make the confidence intervals, predictive intervals and tolerance intervals for theirs auditories.
